This means that the language includes several high-level structures (lists, dictionaries, date / time, complex numbers and others) and a vast collection of modules ready for use, plus third-party frameworks that can be added. It also has features found in other modern languages, such as generators, introspection, persistence, metaclasses and unity tests. Multiparadigm, the language supports modular, functional, and object-oriented programming.\n",
