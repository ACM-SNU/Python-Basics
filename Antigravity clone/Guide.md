## Antigravity Module Clone
Post session, someone asked me how the following module in python worked:
``` python
import antigravity
```
The following is my implementation of the same   
Launch python interpretor and write the following lines of code
``` python
import webbrowser
webbrowser.open("http://xkcd.com/353/")
```

## Implementing your own module
1. Download the clone.py file
2. In the same diretory, open python interpretor and write the following 
``` python
import clone
```
